-- next to their individual earnings:
CREATE VIEW robberies_for_each_robber as (
select robberid,

SUM(share) as total_earnings
from accomplices
GROUP BY robberid);

-- obtain the average amount of robberies:
CREATE VIEW average_robberies as (

-- find the active robbers who participated in more robberies than the average:
CREATE VIEW active_robbers as (

-- create a view with only the nicknames of those robbers
-- in descending order of earnings:
CREATE VIEW nicknames as (
select nickname

ORDER BY total_earnings DESC);

-- finally display the results with a simple select statement:
select * from nicknames;
